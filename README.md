# Drumset
Making a drumset in java for my final project in APCSA

So if keys pressed are the same as the keys indicated in keyPressed in the MyKeyListener file then they will be added to an array list

eventually will have sounds play too

want to be able to have two inputs at the same time

there will be images in the window that will change with key presses
